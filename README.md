  - Protected routes ensure users cannot access certain pages without authentication.  
  - Custom 404 error page displayed for invalid paths.

- **Catalog with Filtering:**  
  - Browse a catalog of dishes.  
  - Filter items by categories.  

- **Cart Management:**  
  - Add/remove items and update quantities via Redux.  
  - Submit orders directly from the cart using React Forms.

- **UI Design:**  
  - Built based on a **Figma** design mockup.  
  - Styled using **SCSS** with modular structure and variables.  
  - Theme switching (light/dark mode) implemented using ‚Äî settings persist across sessions and depends from the browser preferences.

- **State Management:**  
  - Utilized **Redux Toolkit** for clean, organized state management.  
  - Typesafe data handling with **TypeScript**.  

- **Testing:**  
  - **Jest** and **React Testing Library** used to write unit tests for cart logic and boost reliability.
